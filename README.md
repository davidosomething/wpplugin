DKO WP Plugin Framework
=======================

This folder and its contents should be placed into your plugin folder.
The preferred way is as a git submodule or just through copying it to a folder
called ```framework```. Then, require ```framework/base.php``` and make your
plugin class extend the DKOWPPlugin class.
